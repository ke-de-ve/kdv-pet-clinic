WebJars are client-side web libraries (e.g. jQuery & Bootstrap) packaged into JAR (Java Archive) files.
Explicitly and easily manage the client-side dependencies in JVM-based web applications
Use JVM-based build tools (e.g. Maven, Gradle, sbt, ...) to download your client-side dependencies
Know which client-side dependencies you are using
Transitive dependencies are automatically resolved and optionally loaded via RequireJS
Deployed on Maven Central
